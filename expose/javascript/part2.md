Part 2 Question 1:
3
"3" will get printed out because "i" is being declared as a var. Since it is declared as a var, it is function-scoped and exists in the whole function. The length of the list being passed in is 3 so "console.log(i)" will print out 3.

Part 2 Question 2:
150
"150" will get printed out because what it does is it takes all the prices from the list and then multiplies it by 1 minus the discount for each item. In this case, the last item has a price of 300 and the discount is 50%. That gives us a discounted price of 150.

Part 2 Question 3:
150
"150" will get printed out because finalPrice just gets set equal to the discountedPrice with some rounding.

Part 2 Question 4:
[ 50, 100, 150 ]
"[ 50, 100, 150 ]" will be returned from the function call because the function returns a list. That list consists of all the discounted prices, in this case we have 3 all with a 50% discount.
